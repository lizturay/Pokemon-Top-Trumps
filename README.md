A command-line card battle game inspired by the classic *Top Trumps*.  
Built using the **Pok√©API**, this project lets players draw random Pok√©mon and compete based on real in-game stats such as HP, Attack, and Defence.

## Live Demo
*(Runs locally via Python ‚Äî see installation instructions below)*

---

## Overview
This project was created as part of my learning journey in **Python**, **APIs**, and **game logic design**.  
It uses live data from the Pok√©API to generate random Pok√©mon battles and award points based on stat comparisons.

> *Goal:* Be the first to reach your chosen score limit. Win rounds to earn 100 points, draw to earn 50.

---

## Features
- Fetches **real Pok√©mon stats** from the Pok√©API  
- Play as the user or let the CPU choose the stat  
- Options to **attack**, **defend**, or compare specific stats (HP, Attack, etc.)  
- Adjustable **score limit** for flexible gameplay  
- Handles **API errors and invalid inputs** gracefully  
- Clear game loop and score tracking  

---

## Project Purpose
I built this to strengthen my understanding of:
- RESTful API interaction using `requests`  
- Input handling and validation in CLI applications  
- Writing modular, readable Python functions  
- Implementing basic game logic and scoring systems

cd pokemon-top-trumps
python -m venv .venv
# macOS / Linux
source .venv/bin/activate
# Windows
# .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
````

### üß† Run the Game

```bash
python pokemon_top_trumps.py
```

### üì¶ Requirements File

Create a simple `requirements.txt`:

```

## üïπÔ∏è How to Play

1. Enter your target score (e.g. 300).
2. Each round, both you and the CPU draw a random Pok√©mon.
3. Choose who picks the stat ‚Äî you or your opponent.
4. If you select **attack**, your Attack vs. their Defence.
5. If you select **defense**, your Defence vs. their Attack.
6. Winning round = **+100 points**, Draw = **+50 points**.
7. First to reach the score limit wins the game!

## üéÆ Example Gameplay Preview

```
Game to how many points? 300

You drew: Pikachu  vs  Opponent drew: Bulbasaur
Choose the stat yourself or let opponent choose? me
Pick a stat ['id', 'height', 'weight', 'base_experience', 'hp', 'attack', 'defense'] or type 'attack'/'defense':
attack
Stat choice is: attack
Pikachu attacks Bulbasaur
Your attack: 55  |  Opponent defense: 49
You win this round.
Score ‚Äî You: 100 | Opponent: 0
```

## Challenges & Lessons Learned

* Managing asynchronous API calls in a synchronous CLI environment
* Handling errors gracefully when the Pok√©API times out
* Ensuring clean variable scope (no globals) for long-term maintainability
* Structuring Python scripts for readability and reuse
